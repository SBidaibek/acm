00:26 - H0 = some form is achiveable where a constant nu,ber of colors
            are used
00:25 - H1 = its never opt to connect anything other than leaves
00:24 - O0 = something to do ith the diameter
00:08 - H2 = levels at the same depth from the center of diameter
            should be of same isomorphical color
00:03 - O1 = there are many diameters
00:02 - H3 = if to check every dimater a solution will be found
