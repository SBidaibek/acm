02:30 - start
02:30 - analyze samples
02:24 - AFK
02:19 - returned back
02:13 - O0 = vertex 1 is always first
02:13 - interactions of subtress is the problem
02:12 - O1 = at every moment we have set of selectable vertices
02:10 - S1 = slow is DP on selectable sets
02:09 - Q1 = why greedy on sets fails?
02:07 - AQ1 = because order matters
02:05 - H1 = Lex min is the answer
01:57 - H1 is bullshit
01:57 - O2 = subtrees gome smth like from big 0 to small 1
01:56 - start S1
01:39 - degub S1
01:33 - sent S1

O1 = We can change the answer we have by sawpping i & i + 1
    if one is not anc of the other
O2 = If we can move a zero to the left that way its always good
H1 = We can get to opt ans by swapping i & i + 1
H1 is bullshit
H2 = We can get to opt ans by swapping blocks
    if one gets moved to the right
I1 = We can merge parents children if we one is afher another
I2 = We can compare and swap next segments
    if a[i][1] / a[i][0] <= a[i - 1][1] / a[i - 1][0]
I3 = Merge parent segment with minimal child segment
I4 = DSU with small to large
