01:35 - O0 = we can ask consectuive pairs

            may be needed for finding the sign of the difference
01:33 - I0 = we can D&C this thatll be 2n or n querries
im out of form thats bad
01:08 - Q0 = how can i find answer if all the segments are known?
01:05 - HSub1 = lets try both signs one will do
01:04 - if min > max a[i] = n - 1 - a[i]
00:51 - Sub1 is ok!
00:37 - its enough to find the point of dif
        im really dumb atm

1 3 2 4
