2:27 - unpacked
2:20 - read the statement, IMPORTANT: find good samples, a lot can
        be understood
01:58 - trying Sub1
01:57 - H0 = solution is something like BFS from each vertices
            once we get the lemmas about optimal decisions from Sub3&4
01:56 - S1 OK
01:54 - trying S2 with recursive
01:33 - Sub3 - condense the graph, count the comps with goods, check reach
01:33 - Sub4 - delete the goods, condesnse the graph, mark all belonging
                to cycles, check reach
01:30 - debuggin Sub1
01:27 - PAUSE
new 30
00:21 - O1 = we need to select subgraph on n vertices and edges,
            such a graph always has at least one cycle and we can
            analyze who wins with that cycle, at the same time,
            all the other trees poiting to the cycle are of the same
            result
00:20 - Q1 = why would the losing player choose such a cycle?
00:02 - Q2 = why not solve for B since its harder
new 30
00:29 - I1 = lets delete all Rs, condense the graph and count
            with BFS whether any R or cyle of with no R is reachable,
       (H1 =)unm    arked vertices in the end all belong to R
Untimed
        O2 = we can merge vertices once we chose the optimal edge

O3 = R-vertex is reachable from every vertex of the p-cycle it relaxes
I2 = lets relax from each R-vertex. For each lets see whether A can reach
    it, then if there is an edge (R, can reach) all those that can reach
    must be relaxed
O3 is wrong

Looked up the ediorial
