01:52 - unpacked all the files
01:48 - O0 = const 7 in sub3 matters
01:47 - O1 = some problems may be with multiple dots in one point
01:46 - trying to understand the problem and the unknown
01:42 - H0 = wires dont cross
01:39 - possible need a slow
01:39 - S1 = dp on i j
01:38 - started S1
01:30 - submitted S1
01:25 - O2 = in the answer no edge connects 2 points
            with degree > 1
01:18 - I1 = answer consists of consecutive segments
            of same color connected to one dot of
            another color
01:14 - H1 = a blue dot connects only to red dots that
        are after the prev blue and before next blue
01:12 - started Sub3
00:47 - understood the poblem with Sub3
00:41 - trying to find dp for Sub3
00:40 - H1 is bs
00:33 - trying to come up with some dp
00:27 - need some good idea
00:10 - debugging
-00:05 - came up with Su3b
-00:06 - I1 = ans consists of semgents with
        either one blue or one red
-00:30 - undesrtood the concept
-00:33 - I2 = we concatenate either a bunch to one
        or two segements
-00:44 - debugging I2
-00:52 - strssing I2
-01:10 - found bug, got idea of full
