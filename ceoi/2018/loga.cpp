4:40 - started
4:38 - O0 = there are only 2000 + 2000 differnet values
            which allows for dp
4:36 - O01 = there are only 2000 * 50 = 1e5 different objects
4:29 - H0 = looking like dp with little constraints
            but >= f[i] is a little greedy
3:53 - I1 = d[i][j][cash] = n * m * 50
