01:45 - O0 = between a and b all the numbers are covered
01:42 - O1 = 60 = 2 * log or what?
01:41 - O2 = a[m] = a[l] + (m - l) * dir iff no repeat
01:32 - got that I misubderstood prob
01:30 - dist is n / 2 which is not any given number
01:28 - O3 = the numbesr are cyclical
00:58 - H1 = if paths cross
            and n / 2 (or num len of segment) is even answer will be found
