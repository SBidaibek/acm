0:33 - H1 = binsearch
0:33 - H2 = check from center
0:32 - I0 = add all
0:27 - O1 = if a cell isnt added all its adjacent cells arent added
0:22 - O2 = ans is not greater than n + m - 1
0:21 - I1 = we can use sets for each y and x for O2
0:14 - H3 = n + m - 1 is enough and necessary thus the only solution
0:12 - S1 = impl H3
0:00 - H1 is BS

-00:20 - O3 = rows columns are a birpatite graph
-00:20 - O4 - if 2 rows or cols have at least 1 cell in common they or
-00:30 - I2 = merging components by creating cells

2:19 - O1 = we can try make 1st 0 and 1st 1
2:18 - H1 = we can change substrs
2:17 - I1 = swap blocks of same from end
2:17 - started I1
2:09 - I1 got WA4
2:09 - trying to find a sample
1:50 - H2 = its never optimal to break blocks of same
